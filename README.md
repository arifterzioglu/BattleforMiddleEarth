#Description

Our project is called ‘Battle For Middle Earth’. This game is similar to the popular arcade game known as ‘space invader’. The game starts off by displaying a map. Within each map there are different checkpoints; each of these checkpoints represent a different level, similar leveling to that of candy crush. The main object of the game is to reach the final checkpoint on the map. Within each level the user will begin the game at the bottom of the screen and the enemies will occupy the first couple of rows from the top of the screen. The user can attack the enemy, likewise the enemy can attack the user. The user’s health will be indicated by a health bar. In order to help the user in his quest there will be random drops. These drops may be either a health box , an ammunition box which replenishes the user’s ammo supply and a weapon box providing the user with a better and powerful weapons. This game will allows the user to play as different characters from middle earth such as humans, elf or wizards. Each of these characters will possess a unique attribute such as different ammunition type. For the demo we plan to provide 5 levels. For the first four levels the user will face off against normal orks(enemy). Finally in level fifth level the user will face off against the boss. To conclude, the player’s score will be recorded and a high score system will be produced.
