#Description

Our project is called ‘Battle For middle Earth’. This is game is similar to the then popular arcade game known as ‘space invader’. After the first start game screen, there will be a map that shows the levels, similar to that written in candy crush. The goal is reaching the last level of the map. The main objective of the game is that the user will be begin the game at the bottom of the screen and the enemies will occupy the first couple of rows from the top of the screen. The user can attack the enemy likewise the enemy can attack the user. The user’s health will be indicated by a health bar. Also during the game there will be some extra health, weapon and ammo boxes that if the user reach these boxes he gain a full health from health box and he gain more powerfull weapon from weapon box. The game allows the user to select different character from middle earth such as humans, elf and wizards, each of these character will posses a unique attribute such as ammunation type. All of them will fight against the orks.  For the demo we planned to make 5 levels. At the fifth level the player will face with a boss. Also we count the player’s high scores.
